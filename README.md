## Terminal.sublime-plugin

Sublime plugin that adds an "Open Terminal Here.." utility.

### Installation

Just drop the compressed `Terminal.sublime-package` package into Sublime's
`Installed Packages` directory, for example:

```bash
cp Terminal.sublime-package  ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Installed\ Packages/
```

..and then restart Sublime. 

### Usage

After installation a new menu entry will be available:

    Goto -> Open Terminal Here (CTRL+T)
    Command Palette -> Terminal: Open Terminal Here

While in your editor you can use the hotkey `CTRL+T` (or `COMMAND+T` for OSX)
to open a terminal at the location of the current file being edited.
